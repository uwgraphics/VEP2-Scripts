# A directory of the most recent outputs from the scripts. 

This is probably *ad hoc* - but it gives at least one output in case 
something happens and the data vanishes.

For a user: this can give you an example of what the scripts produce
so you can decide if you want to re-run them using more up-to-date
data.
